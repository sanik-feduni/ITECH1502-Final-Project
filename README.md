## 🧠 Reflection Summary
This hands-on experience taught me how phishing attacks combine social engineering and technical deception.  
I learned to analyse emails systematically, verify domains, and apply **NIST CSF Detect/Respond** principles.  
Completing the lab improved my technical accuracy, attention to detail, and documentation skills — essential for SOC and cybersecurity roles.
