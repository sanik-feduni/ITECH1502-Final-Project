## Project Purpose & Overview

This repository serves as both my **capstone assessment for ITECH1502 ‚Äì Cybersecurity Fundamentals** and a **career-ready cybersecurity portfolio**.  
It demonstrates my ability to analyse phishing threats, apply security frameworks, and document professional outcomes using hands-on work on the **TryHackMe** platform.  

This project strengthens my technical and analytical skills for entry-level cybersecurity roles such as **SOC Analyst**, **Cybersecurity Intern**, and **Threat Analyst**.

## Project Summary

The project focused on detecting and analysing phishing attacks through the **TryHackMe ‚ÄúPhishing Emails in Action‚Äù** challenge.  
I investigated real phishing email examples, identified indicators of compromise (IoCs), and applied the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Detect & Respond)** to validate threats and recommend mitigation measures.

- **Platform:** TryHackMe  
- **Room:** *Phishing Emails in Action*  
- **Tasks Completed:** 8  
- **Completion:** 100%  
- **Score:** 56 Points

## Reflection Summary

This hands-on project taught me how phishing attacks exploit both human trust and technical weaknesses.  
I learned to systematically investigate suspicious emails, verify sender authenticity, and identify spoofed URLs and domains.  
It also improved my ability to connect **cybersecurity frameworks** (like NIST CSF) with practical incident analysis.  

A key challenge was distinguishing legitimate domains from spoofed ones under pressure, which helped me understand the importance of analytical precision and critical thinking in real-world security environments.  

Completing this project enhanced my confidence in:
- **Incident analysis and response**
- **Email forensics and phishing detection**
- **Security documentation and reporting**
- **Analytical thinking and attention to detail**
